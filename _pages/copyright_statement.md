### Website Structure and GitHub
This website was created starting from the [Reverie template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie). It is hosted through GitHub Pages. GitHub is designed to make copying and remixing a repository easy via forking. I forked and modified the Reverie template to create this website. Because of that, I do not own the specific structure of the website (where content and material is placed, WidgetBot comment setup, etc.). 

Since the website is based on Reverie, I want to make the structure available for you to use freely. To accomplish that, I've create a [Jekyll theme for you called Explorer](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/tree/main)! This way you can avoid any problems or confusion with copyright on my own content.

That being said, if you do fork my blog's repo, still follow the Creative Commons license above: Before publishing, I ask that you delete all my content and material (any text, blog posts, resources, images, the logo, etc.). Essentially, make it look like the [Explorer template](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/tree/main).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to [reach out]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/)!
