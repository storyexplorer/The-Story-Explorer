I am an affiliate with [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/). This means that if you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, I will earn a commission. It does not cost you anything extra. I will mark any affilate link on the [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources) page or any in posts so you know what you're clicking on. Bookshop.org is a cool organization that directly supports independent booksellers. You can read [more about them here](https://bookshop.org/info/about-us). On top of supporting that, a purchase through one of my Bookshop.org affiliate links or through my Bookshop.org storefront will help support the Story Explorer and my own writing endevors. You also do not need to purchase one of my listed recommendations either to support me. So long as you click through one of my links or my storefront and see the Story Explorer logo in the top left, I earn will earn a commission on your purchase. Thank you for the support!
