The Story Explorer is here for building a community around and learning about storytelling. It's not for me to track you. All the services I chose to use on The Story Explorer do not share your data with me.

Just to be thorough, there are a few things I'd like you to be aware of when it comes to privacy.

### Discord and WidgetBot
I am using [Discord](https://discord.com/) to build The Story Explorer community and to run comments on posts. I use [WidgetBot](https://widgetbot.io/) to embed the Discord server and run comment sections. 

Here are some links you may want to check:
- [Discord's privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy)
- [WidgetBot's privacy policy](https://widgetbot.io/privacy)
- [WidgetBot's cookie policy](https://widgetbot.io/cookie)

Here are some things I've found about these services:
- [Discord is GDPR compliant and privacy conscious](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003858092-Privacy-Policy-Update-and-GDPR-FAQ). Discord's privacy policy also details [how you can control your privacy with their service](https://discord.com/privacy#8).
- WidgetBot uses cookies and third-parties for its services. You will notice a cookie from The Story Explorer if you check cookies on your browser. This cookie comes from WidgetBot. Feel free to experiment with blocking cookies, but I cannot guarentee that the comment section will still work.
- While on a Story Explorer post, you may notice your content blocker (such as [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) or [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)) pick up on WidgetBot's and Discord's thrid-party services. I cannot guarentee commenting will still work properly, but feel free to experiment blocking them if you'd like. 
- WidgetBot's main funcationality comes from a third-party service called jsDelivr. [jsDelivr's privacy policy](https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy) (section 9.3) explains that their third-party services have access to your IP address and other information sent by your web browser. But do not fret: they do not track any individual user, and they only use the information they gather for analytics and security.

All this being said, the companies and services listed above do *not* share any data with me.

Finally, please keep in mind that any info you choose to share in a comment through The Story Explorer Discord will be visible to those who visit the site. That being said, please don't forget to be respectful and kind. We're all here to learn and share! :) 

### GitHub
Since this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub logs and stores your IP address for security reasons. Further information can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection). GitHub does *not* share any of your information with me.

### Bookshop.org
Related to [affiliate links]({{site.baseurl}}/disclosure), Bookshop.org does *not* share customer data with their normal affiliates (i.e. people like me). You can read more info on [Bookshop's FAQ](https://bookshop.org/info/about-us).
