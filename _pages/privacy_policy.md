I do not collect any data or information from you at the moment. I may start an email list, so I will update this page when I have that set up.

Since this site is hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub logs and stores your IP address for security reasons. Further information can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection).

Related to [affiliate links]({{site.baseurl}}/disclosure), Bookshop.org does *not* share customer data with their normal affiliates (i.e. people like me). You can read more info on [Bookshop's FAQ](https://bookshop.org/info/about-us).
