<i>Exploring the craft of storytelling</i>
</div>

The purpose of The Story Explorer is to explore the craft of storytelling. I plan to write posts and share resources that engage in the fundamentals of the craft. By engaging with the fundamentals, I hope to provide a place where you can come and learn about how to tell more meaningful stories. The learning process never ends, so I'll be right there with you. 

This website is for anyone interested in storytelling. As human beings we all share the ability to tell stories. Storytelling is the foundation of how we communicate. So, whether you're a novelist, songwriter, scientist, filmmaker, journalist, or just someone wanting to send better emails, this place is for you.

I began actively learning about storytelling in 2018. At the time, I was a [student research scientist and engineer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmcdPhIAAAAJ&hl=en), and (my favorite) part of my job was teaching and tutoring. I found storytelling to be incredibly interesting and an incredibly helpful tool. I was able to better serve my students and improve my research communication. About a year after that, I started exploring creative writing and science communication and haven't stopped since. 

The foundation of my understanding of storytelling comes from [Brian McDonald](https://writeinvisibleink.com/). From first reading *[Invisible Ink]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/#invisible-ink)* in 2019 to his [Storytelling 101 course](https://youareastoryteller.podia.com/) in January 2023, I keep going back to Brian's insights on the craft. I have used his tools in my teaching, research communication, and creative work -- all with positive results. I also aim to use Brian's observation-based approach to storytelling here.

As for my own creative work, it is in progress (as of writing in December 2023). The goal for my creative works is this: Create stories that are sustenance for the heart and life of others. More to come...

Besides the above, I also enjoy listening to and playing music, cooking, going for walks, and learning (I'm curious about almost everything). As for music, my main instrument is guitar, and occasionally I dabble in songwriting for fun.
