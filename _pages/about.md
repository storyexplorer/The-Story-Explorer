<i>Exploring storytelling and the stories we live by</i>
</div>

The Story Explorer is all about exploring what makes a story meaningful. How do we craft stories that we can feel, that people connect with and are moved by?

To explore these ideas and questions, I plan to publish blog posts and resources that cover three broad categories:

1. *Story Fundamentals* \\
    Generally discuss and teach the fundamentals of storytelling along with some of my own ideas on the craft. 

2. *Story Analysis* \\
    Showing story fundamentals in action in various books, movies, songs/albums, and poems.

3. *Stories We Live By* \\
    Open-ended dives into the stories, language, and metaphors that shape our lives. The topic name was inspired by the book *Metaphors We Live By* authored by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson.

Storytelling can be applied to a lot of topics ranging anywhere from science to literature, film to marketing, music to poetry. My hope is that I can communicate a new and slightly different perspective on storytelling that includes the fundamentals of how we communicate, understand meaning, and experience the world. All so that we can tell more meaningful stories.

The Story Explorer is currently hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I built the site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), starting from the [Reverie theme template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).

I started learning about storytelling in 2018 to improve my teaching and communication of [my research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmcdPhIAAAAJ&hl=en). The next year -- after being inspired by Philip Pullman's *The Secret Commonwealth* -- I started creative writing. Ever since, I've been exploring ways to write meaningful stories. I decided to make this website in 2022 to share and teach about my ongoing endeavors in storytelling. 

My ultimate goal is to write books with well-crafted stories that I and others find meaning in (which hopefully leads to something to share and sell!). I typically read and craft stories in the fantasy genre: I love how metaphors can be reimagined in new and really cool ways. Besides the above, I also enjoy listening to and playing music, cooking, and going for walks. As for music, my main instrument is guitar, and occasionally I dabble in songwriting for fun.
