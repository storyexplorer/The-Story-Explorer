<i>Exploring the craft of storytelling</i>
</div>

The purpose of The Story Explorer is to explore the craft of storytelling. I plan to write posts and share resources that engage in the fundamentals of the craft. By engaging with the fundamentals, I hope to provide a place where you can come and learn about how to tell more meaningful stories.

This website is for anyone interested in storytelling. As human beings we all share the ability to tell stories. Storytelling is the foundation of how we communicate. So, whether you're a novelist, songwriter, filmmaker, journalist, or just someone wanting to send better emails, this place is for you.

Have questions, comments, suggestions? [I'd love to hear from you!]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)

The Story Explorer is currently hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I built the site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), starting from the [Reverie theme template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).

I began making a conscious effort to learn more about storytelling in 2018. At the time, I was a [research scientist and engineer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmcdPhIAAAAJ&hl=en), and (my favorite) part of my job was teaching and tutoring. I quickly found storytelling to be incredibly interesting and an incredibly helpful tool. I was able to better serve my students and improve my research communication. About a year that, I started exploring creative writing and science communication, and haven't stopped since. 

I learned the bulk of my storytelling knowledge from [Brian McDonald](https://writeinvisibleink.com/). I took Brian's [Storytelling 101 class](https://youareastoryteller.podia.com/) in January 2023 and found it to be an invaluable resource. On top of being an awesome person and storyteller, Brian is a great teacher. Everything he teaches is based on real-world observation of how people tell stories to each other. As a scientist, I was drawn to Brian's teaching approach, and I hope to carry it on here. 

As for my own creative work, it is still in progress as of December 2023. I am in the process of honing my craft and writing stories. The goal for my creative works is this: Create stories that are sustenance for the heart and life of others. More to come on this.

Besides the above, I also enjoy listening to and playing music, cooking, going for walks, and learning (I'm curious about almost everything). As for music, my main instrument is guitar, and occasionally I dabble in songwriting for fun.
