<i>Exploring stories, storytelling, and the stories we live by</i>
</div>

The Story Explorer is all about exploring what makes a story meaningful. How do we craft stories that we can feel, that people connect with and are moved by?

To explore these ideas and questions, I plan to publish blog posts and resources that cover three broad categories:

1. *Story Fundamentals* \\
    Generally discuss and teach the fundamentals of story and storytelling along with some of my own ideas on the craft. 

2. *Story Analysis* \\
    Showing story fundamentals in action in various books, movies, songs/albums, and poems.

3. *Stories We Live By* \\
    Open-ended dives into the stories, language, and metaphors that shape our lives. The topic name was inspired by the book *Metaphors We Live By* authored by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson.

Storytelling can be applied to a lot of topics ranging anywhere from science to literature, film to marketing, music to poetry. My hope is that I can communicate a new and slightly different perspective on storytelling that includes how metaphor is at the foundation of the ways we communicate, understand meaning, and experience the world. All so that we can tell more meaningful stories.

Have questions, comments, suggestions? [I'd love to hear from you!]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)

The Story Explorer is currently hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I built the site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), starting from the [Reverie theme template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).

## About the Author

I started learning about storytelling in 2018 to improve my teaching and communication of [my research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmcdPhIAAAAJ&hl=en). The next year -- after being inspired by Philip Pullman's *The Secret Commonwealth* -- I started creative writing. Ever since, I've been exploring ways to write meaningful stories. I decided to make The Story Explorer in 2022 to share and teach about my ongoing endeavors in storytelling. 

My ultimate goal is to create well-crafted, meaningful stories and write them as books. I typically read and craft stories that would land in the fantasy genre. I love how metaphors can be reimagined in new and really cool ways when our physical reality is no longer a bound on the story, espeically when those metaphors end up showing us something meaningful about the reality of human experience and/or our world. Besides the above, I also enjoy listening to and playing music, cooking, and going for walks. As for music, my main instrument is guitar, and occasionally I dabble in songwriting for fun.
