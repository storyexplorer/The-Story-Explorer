categories: [Story Fundamentals]
excerpt: Story structures outline how conceptual systems can change through narrative.

- There are so many different types of story structures and I feel like everyone swears by their own favorite:
    - Freytag's Pyramid
    - Three Act 
    - Five Act
    - Seven Part
    - Story Arcs
    - Hero's Journey
    - ... and so on ...

- And obviously three act strucutre is the best and -- just kidding! There's something deeper going on here.
- I realized that all story structures really are the same. They just offer a different perspecitve on the same thing 

- After hearing Meg LeFauve explain how she thought about the strucutre of Inside Out -- combined with the ideas from the metaphor post -- this all clicked for me.

<!-- This would be good for a post on character/world belief systems -->
<!-- - Many writers talk about a character's or world's belief system, and this is a great term. Although, I use the idea of the conceptual system because this can include conscious and *unconscious* beliefs. Without going down the philosophy of consciousness vs experientialism rabbit hole, we are so surrounded by metaphor that it's sort of like the story of the fish searching for water. I sometimes find in stories I really like -- just like in real life -- that character's aren't necessarily aware of some of their beliefs and where they originate: they are so embedded in their body and mind that they are not necessarily conscious of it. There may not have been one specific reason why this happened (looking at you Freud for balming everything on childhood)... -->

- Exmaple of Inside Out --> just go listen to the last 7 minutes of THIS EPISODE. Hear from the master herself on this topic.

- My view on structure:
    - Thematic
    - Stakes
    - characters
    - setting
    - Structure of using thematic and stakes embedded in character and settings to shift/reveal conceptual system of world and/or character that shows the thematic. 
    - It's the shift in conceptual system that leads to the shift in action. And it's the shift in (embodied!) action that makes something meaningful!
