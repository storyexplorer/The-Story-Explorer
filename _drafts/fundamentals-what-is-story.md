Welcome to The Story Explorer!

Before diving in, you might be wondering, What is The Story Explorer? Besides whatâ€™s on the [about]({{ sit.baseurl }}/about) page, this question is best answered with another question:

**What is Story?**

There are a lot of answers out there to this question, but it seems Aristotle knew the answer a couple thousand years ago:

"Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic poetry, and the music of the flute and of the lyre in most of the forms, are all in their general conception modes of imitation."

And Aristotle elaborates what is being imitated: "character, emotion, and action" and "moral differences" [[^poetics]]. Essentially Aristotle is saying that story is a reflection of human exerpeience and meaning. 

The short answer: Story is metaphor.

How did I arrive at this answer? Stories are created through some sort of medium.
