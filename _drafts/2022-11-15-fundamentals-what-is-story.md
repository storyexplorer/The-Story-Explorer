title: What is a Story?
categories: [Story Fundamentals]
excerpt:
---

When I first sat down to write this, I had a curious realization: I thought I knew what a story was, but I could not come up with a good definition. One that informs the experience of a story and the craft of telling one. I simply couldn’t do it. 

Not having a good answer felt like a huge hole in my knowledge of storytelling. A good definition can bring clarity and focus to anything you do. If you don’t know what something is, how do you know what to do to accomplish that thing? How do you know what you’re telling *is* a story? When working with a team, how do you accomplish anything if everyone has a different definition of the goal?

**So, what is a story?**

As human beings, we are surrounded by stories, and this makes answering the question difficult. Mark Turner’s research even points to the idea that parable (the mental projection of story onto ourselves and/or other things) is the foundation of the human mind and likely was the origin of language itself [[^Turner]]. We all communicate, so we all tell and consume stories. We tell and consume them through conversations, books, research papers, movies, presentations, music, pictures, emails, etc. Stories are hard to define and learn about because they are so natural to us, and they are everywhere. 

Regardless, I still wanted to find an answer. While researching, I came across many definitions, but most were unclear, felt incomplete, or described instead of defined. I finally ended up turning to none other than Brian McDonald. 

McDonald is a master storyteller. He is a highly esteemed and award-winning director, screenwriter, author, producer, and teacher [[^mcdonald]]. One of the first books I ever read on storytelling was his incredible *Invisible Ink* [[^invisible-ink]], which I cannot recommend enough. McDonald has even taught storytelling courses at places like Pixar, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), and Disney. We can trust what McDonald has to say about telling a story. 

McDonald gave an insightful answer to the exact question on two different episodes of his podcast You Are a Storyteller [[^YAAS], [^YAAS-1], [^YAAS-2]], which he co-hosts with Jesse Bryan. (I also recently attended one of Brian’s storytelling courses -- it was fantastic! -- and during one of the meetings, we spent a good amount of time discussing this question as a class too.)

I thought this would be a great place to start *The Story Explorer*. It’s a good question to explore, whether you’ve never written a story before or have years of experience. And I think it’s the most fundamental question we can ask.  

I am still continuing to understand the layers of meaning in McDonald’s definition, and only time and practice will make them clearer. The rest of this post will describe what I’ve learned from McDonald about the definition of story, as I currently understand it.

## What is a Story?

Precise and elegant. The first time I heard it, I felt like McDonald just gave words to something I had known all along. And well, that’s exactly what he did. McDonald’s definition comes not only from observations of crafted stories (film, comics, books, TV, etc.) but also how we speak. 

As mentioned above, story (parable) is likely the origin of language itself [[^Turner]], so we can look at how we talk to understand stories. Further, Aristotle opens *Poetics* with the following observation: stories, in any of the arts, are forms of imitation [[^poetics]]. A definition of story that comes from or imitates the way we talk, will ultimately help us tell a good story.

Now let’s break down the definition’s three parts:
1. “the telling or retelling” -- stories can be told or retold events. The “telling” can take place in any communicative medium (visual, written, auditory, etc.).
2. “a sequence of events”-- stories demonstrate multiple connected events, or “happenings”.  This means that a single image cannot be a story on its own. Although, a single image can imply a story. Norman Rockwell has many great examples such as *Jury* [[^jury-room]].
3. “leading to a conclusion”-- McDonald qualifies that by conclusion he does not mean an end but a *point*. Stories *say* something. The point is what McDonald calls the *armature* of a story.

I think we can agree that the stories we tell or experience will meet Part 1. It takes some time to fully understand Part 2, but it holds after digesting it for a while. What about Part 3? It’s this last insight that separates McDonald’s definition and makes things very interesting and useful. 

## What’s the Point?
Let’s look at an example story someone might tell in conversation:

“I had the best weekend ever at the beach. Everything was perfect. I kept my phone in the hotel room, so nobody bothered me, and I spent all Saturday in the sand and water. It was sunny and warm, the ocean was refreshing, it was nice and quiet and relaxing, and I saw just the most gorgeous sunset. Then Saturday night, I went to a local restaurant and had the tastiest seafood I’ve ever had. I did it all over again on Sunday too. Last weekend won’t ever be topped.”

Notice how this starts with why the person is telling the story,“I had the best weekend ever at the beach”. This introduction tells us the context and the point of the story: we’re going to hear about the best weekend ever at the beach. Then, the middle of the story tells the sequence of events that demonstrate why it was the best weekend ever: “nobody bothered me”, “all Saturday on the beach”, “tastiest seafood”. Finally the story concludes and reaffirms the point, “Last weekend won’t ever be topped”. The story starts and ends with the point, which is proven by the middle.

From this example we can also observe a three-part structure that naturally appears when we tell stories. Here is one way to look at this: a story is a proposal, argument, and conclusion. In conversation, the proposal and conclusion are often the same; they tell us the point. The argument then demonstrates the proposal so that when we get to the conclusion we understand the point. When we tell stories, we naturally structure them to lead to a point.

Now that we’ve seen the definition of story in conversation, let’s look at the point in more detail. There are many words I’ve seen and heard used to describe the point of a story. For now, I am only going to focus on armature and “theme”. Let’s look briefly at each to see how they inform the definition, specifically how they aid story structure.

## Armature
In sculpting, armatures are a skeletal framework used to support the finished piece. Without an armature, the piece would eventually collapse under its own weight. As a consequence, sculptors must explore and understand what they want to make before they start the finished piece. McDonald uses this analogy to explain what the armature of a story is.

McDonald defines armature as, “what you want to say with your piece” [[^invisible-ink], [^brian-armature-blog]]. The armature is a clear and concise sentence describing the single idea your story is demonstrating or proving. For example, in the conversational story above, “I had the best weekend ever” is the armature of that story. The armature is the main structural component that keeps a story precise and together. Everything in the story is based on the armature; it is the foundation on which the story is built. The armature is the point to which the story leads. 

## “Theme”
I have seen and heard the word “theme” used in so many different ways that it has lost some meaning to me. I often read or hear others discuss how stories are about certain themes, “This story is about ‘sadness’ and ‘innocence’.” From a craft perspective, these words can help us get started, but they don’t say much on their own. They do not lead to what should be dramatized to make a point in your story. What exactly do you want to say about “sadness” and/or “innocence”? 

I do not want to completely throw away the word theme though. There are some master storytellers who use the word to describe what McDonald means by armature. For instance, Philip Pullman [[^Pullman]], refers to “theme” as what he is trying to say in a story [[^daemon-voices]]. 

## Example Armatures
So instead of having general “theme” words or multiple “themes”, we could create armatures like these: 
1. “Sadness connects us.” [[^TSL-27]] -- *Inside Out*
2. While innocence is inevitably lost, the heart can return. -- *Barefoot Kid* by The Arcadian Wild
3. Grief is love persevering. -- *WandaVision*
4. You may already have what you’re looking for. -- *The Wizard of Oz*
5. Slow and steady wins the race. -- *The Tortoise and the Hare* by Aesop
6. You get to choose who you are. -- *The Iron Giant*
7. “If we want wisdom, we have to leave the innocence behind.” [[^daemon-voices]] -- *His Dark Materials* (series) by Philip Pullman
8. Those you love will always be with you. -- *Harry Potter* (series) by JK Rowling
9. Get busy living or get busy dying. -- *Shawshank Redemption* 
10. Even in the darkest of times, you can hold onto and show humanity. -- *Schindler’s List*

Learning how to identify an armature in a crafted story takes practice and sometimes multiple viewings of a story [[^footnote]]. Usually it is demonstrated through specific character actions, and sometimes it is spoken directly. Although the precise sentence helps, the armature can also be expressed in terms of how a character changes or what they learn through the story.

## Conclusion

> A story is the telling or retelling of a sequence of events leading to a conclusion.

> -- Brian McDonald

McDonald’s definition leads us from natural language to the fundamental observation that stories have a structure that communicates a point or conclusion. 

The armature is what you want to say, the point you want to make. Instead of a single word or idea you add to a story, the armature is a precise and demonstrable sentence that informs how the story is built and shaped. Each event that a story is made of should demonstrate or support the armature in some way. In other words, the story *is* the armature.

When we tell a story -- or if we just want to communicate clearly --  we need to follow this definition. Take a moment to think about what you want to say before you tell a story; in your next email, write the armature in the subject line; if you’re writing a longer piece, take time to explore what your armature is exactly and what will best support it. Otherwise, we may not end up telling a story or we may not be clearly understood.

I am still understanding all of the implications and other questions the definition brings up too: What is the storyteller’s responsibility to the audience? Why do we tell stories? How do we decide what should be included in a story? I’ll be exploring these questions and more in future posts. In the meantime, go out and try to observe the definition of story for yourself and keep exploring.
