Welcome to The Story Explorer!

You might be wondering, What is The Story Explorer? Besides what’s on the [about]({{ sit.baseurl }}/about) page, this question is best answered with more questions. And I promise there’s an answer at the end (followed by more questions to explore!).

**First, What is a storyteller’s goal?**

I originally heard this question elaborated on by Michael Arndt on The Screenwriting Life podcast [^1]. And I think it applies to anyone telling stories or communicating: writers, poets, musicians, academics, scientists, etc.

Michael Arndt’s idea is this: 

> Movies that you saw years ago, you remember a handful of scenes and you remember how they made you feel... Everyone has their own process and goals...My goal is not to articulate an idea; my goal is to create a feeling that the audience has when they walk out of the theater because that's what they'll remember.

One of the storyteller’s goals is to evoke emotion in the audience. And I add that in order evoke emotion, there needs to be *meaning*. (Note: To echo Arndt, you can have your own goals and ideas as a storyteller. Everything here is just one point of view.)

As an additional point, writing meaningful and emotionally resonant stories is not only important and very satisfying for the author, but it's also good for selling stories. As Brian McDonald says in his book *Invisible Ink*, “Good story is good business” [[2](#references)].

If we can figure out a way to craft a meaningful story (a “good story”), then not only can we satisfy our creative desire to write a story but also pay the bills. Good stories evoke emotion and have value and meaning (emotional and monetary) to the audience and author.

I agree fully with Arndt and McDonald. I originally got inspired to write because I felt my favorite books, music, and movies were moving and very meaningful. They made me realize something new about the world and/or myself, and I wanted to try creating some stories that did just that. But when I tried, and tried again, and again, and again (you get the picture) most everything fell flat.

But we're also left with another conundrum: the communication of a story is usually one sided. When the audience is experiencing the story, the meaning is created through their own internal experience of it. As Philip Pullman mentions in his essay entitled "Intention", which discusses what authors may or may not intend in their writing, "All we can honestly intend to do is try" [[5](#references)]. Meaning is created both by the author and audience in the "democratic nature of reading", as Pullman calls it.

**Ok, so we want to *try* to create meaningful stories. But what does *meaning* mean exactly?**

Let’s break this question down by looking at the language we use to describe a story that has meaning to us.

I don’t know about you, but I feel this way when crafting or experiencing meaningful stories; and I’ve heard others describe their favorite stories like this too: 
- You find clarity in it
- You are moved emotionally
- You remember a specific action/event from the story
- The story resonates with you

“Finding clarity in”, “moved by”, “resonating” are all metaphors that describe a meaningful story. Meaningful story is clarity, emotionally moving, resonating.

**Alright, so how do we craft something that’s clear, moving, and resonating? How do we evoke emotion? Where does the meaning *really* come from?**

Well, I couldn’t  find an exact answer in the storytelling books and resources I read. Nor did directly asking Google help, even though I found a lot of hints on what makes a story meaningful:
- “it has to have meaning to you”
- “it has to have a theme”
- “there has to be setup and payoff”
- “characters have to change”
- “there has to be subtext”
- “universal premise and characters”
- And so on…

And all of this is true. But I’ve yet to come across an exploration of what exactly in a story creates meaning without answers that are just more metaphors for meaning itself or elements of a story. And I’ve even experienced (and written) plenty of stories with all these things, and they still fall flat to me. What is required to transform these elements of a "good story" into a good and meaningful story?

I also am very much aware that people like Michale Arndt, Meg LeFauve, Philip Pullman, Suzanne Collins, and all the other masters of the storytelling craft (please forgive me for not listing all of them, there are many to look up to!) know how to create a meaningful story. Not only that, they all do this very consistently.

**So there must be something deeper going on...What exactly are the masters of storytelling doing, even if they may not be aware of it?**

In another essay from Daemon Voices titled "Poco a Poco", Pullman also mentioned the idea of how he uses image schemas to convey ...

Then it was none other than the brilliant Meg LeFauve who offered a very interesting hint: during one of The Screenwriting Life podcasts I can't remember! 
> The story *is* the metaphor.
- Meg LeFauve --FIGURE OUT how to do the blockquote dash reference thing

Realizing my writing and storytelling weren't getting much better, I went ahead and kept asking questions and exploring what LeFauve meant above and how it combined with Pullman's story particles. My background is in scientific and engineering research (Yes, the sciences and arts can exist together, but that's a Stories We Live By post for another day), so I gladly went down the research rabbit hole. It ended up being a very fun and rewarding experience (at least for me!) that involved some psychology, philosophy, sociology, neuroscience, and linguistics. My research naturally led to trying to understand how and why we as human beings experience meaning. And we experience meaning through metaphor and understanding values. (NEED CITATION, Johonson Embodied Understanding...need to look at that again to get wording right, or even pull a quote!)

The last pieces of my research came together after watching Michael Arndt's storytelling videos [[?????](#references)]. Arndt's storytelling philosophy was the first to my knowledge to point out how external and interal stakes alone did not make a story meaningful. So, he added philosophical stakes, which include the underlying value system of the world and characters. Finally, after hearing Arndt himself respond to the questions I’ve been asking here [[3](#references)], I figured it was time to share what I found and try to add to the collective ideas of storytelling.

So, here is an answer to two different questions. First, Where does meaning come from? Second, the very original question of the post that everyone, along with myself, has already forgotten, What is The Story Explorer?

**Meaning originates from the metaphors we choose and craft for all the elements of a story. When these metaphors are crafted with consistency and clarity, they bring the audience into the story's conceptual system (belief/values system) without them realizing. Then if the metaphors change and/or reveal the underlying conceptual system in an embodied way, they allow us to understand the story and project it onto themselves without conscious thought. The new understanding -- even if subconscious -- can spark catharsis, self-understanding, and evoke emotion that can create a memory or even change one’s conceptual system. The meaning comes from the metaphors -- the embodied experiences -- we understand and *experience* through the story.**

**The Story Explorer is a blog about exploring these ideas and how we can use them to craft meaningful stories.**

There is a *lot* more to this than what's above, and it likely doesn't make full sense. But it sets everything up for the foundation of story: **meatphor**. In short meatphor is embodied meaning, and recent evidence from neuroscience suggests that ... (Brain scans something show how metaphor does mirror neurons and whatnot, Lisa Cron has some leads --> source 7 in introduction). So we need to understand metaphor to understand meaningful stories, and there's a lot more to metaphor than I originally thought a few years ago. 

I assure you that this is not a purely academic and logical process. For lack of better words, it is *imaginative rationality* at work [[4](#references)]. It is all about trying to communicating emotion in a way that is structured for others to physcially feel and understand: it's all about communicating metaphors, which may even be subconscious to us. But we can use storytelling tools like thematic, structure, stakes, character, plot, etc. to try our best to understand what we are communicating and accomplish this communication of feeling and meaning to others. I plan to write a post about how you might about this process of using storytelling tools to embed metaphor in a story.

In the end, this answer took me about 3 years of writing, analysis, research, and trial-and-error just to begin to understand. Of course, this was not something I could come up with myself either. I am building on the ideas of many storytellers who I consider to be masters and those who share their knowledge of the craft in some way. In particular, much of this is standing on these storytelling giants: Meg LeFauve, Michael Arndt, Philip Pullman, Brian McDonald, and others I list in my [resources]({{ sit.baseurl }}/resources). I also must give credit to George Lakoff and Mark Johnson for their book *Meatphors We Live By* [[4](#references)] (and to Philip Pullman's *Daemon Voices* [[5](#references)] which led me to Lakoff, Johnson, and Mark Turner). Lakoff and Johnson quite literally wrote the books on metaphor, meaning, and understanding along with their framework of experientialist philosophy. I will discuss these other resources in upcoming posts.

Although I am still an emerging writer, I’ve found these ideas to be very valuable in my own storytelling. I can at least say I now enjoy and find meaning in my own stories along with the exploration required to create them.

Which brings us to the big questions for the next posts: 
- What is metaphor? 
- How do I use metaphor to craft a meaningful story?

I hope to share with you what I’ve found -- and still continue to learn -- so that we can all tell more meaningful stories. Are you ready to start exploring some stories?

(And maybe some day I'll write a post about the compass logo...don't worry, it's also a meataphor. : ) )
