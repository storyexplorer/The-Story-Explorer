<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Metaphor Is Embodied Experience</span>

- There are a ton of definitions out there about metaphor:
    - List...
- But none of them fully capture what a meatphor really *is*. So what exactly is a metaphor?
- This all goes back to the beginnings of my storytelling adventures:
- I kept trying to figure out how to write meaningful stories. At first, my own writing and stories were dull and they didn't match the feelings I wanted to convey or they didn't evoke anything at all -- they didn't have any meaning. And this didn't change until I realized that the foundation of a story is metaphor. 
- After a ton of research and exploration, a few things came together for me to realize this:
    1. Read Daemon Voices by Pullman and learned about [story particles and image schemas]() (LINK TO LIST)
    2. Meg LeFauve said in one of the episodes of TSL: "The story *is* the metaphor."
    3. Looking up The Literary Mind by Mark Turner as recommended by Pullman.
    4. Finding Michael Arndt's resources on storytelling
    5. Finding George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's book, Meaphors We Live By
    6. Revisiting all of this and wandering around with the ideas, trying something and comparing to stories I like, repeat till the ideas made more sense and stopped changing. ("scientific" process of idea, test, update, repeat, ...)

- This all led me to understanding:
    - You feel the thematic during the action shift
    - Structure of using thematic and stakes embedded in character, settings, and narrative/plot to shift/reveal conceptual system of world and/or character that shows the thematic. 
    - **It's the shift in conceptual system that leads to the shift in action. And it's the shift in (embodied!) action that makes something meaningful!**

- Metaphors are what we use to understand something in different terms. Usually something abstract in more human terms.
- Since meatphor is *embodied* experience, an effective and affective metaphor needs to relate back to the body. 
    - We can easily end up with metaphors that fall flat or are too abstract
    - In these that are not coherent i.e. that do not make sense or need context) and metaphors that are too abstract (i.e that do not relate back to gestalts, not grounded in experience)
        - Fall flat/abstract: The flowing knives cut deep.
        - Now just give it a little context: Your words are a river of knives that cut through my heart.

- active vs passive metaphor/schemas...making them active
- And it's ok if your metaphors don't make sense at the moment. You can always learn and practice.
