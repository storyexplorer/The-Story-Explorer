[The Story Explorer](https://storyexplorer.github.io) is a blog that aims to explore the craft of storytelling.

This website was created using Jekyll starting from the [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) template and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

Since the website is based on Reverie, I want to make the structure available for you to use freely. To accomplish that, I've create a [Jekyll theme for you called Explorer](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/tree/main)! This way you can avoid any problems or confusion with copyright on my own content.

That being said, if you do fork my blog's repo, still follow the Creative Commons license above: Before publishing, I ask that you delete all my content and material (any text, blog posts, resources, images, the logo, etc.). Essentially, make it look like the [Explorer template](https://github.com/storyexplorer/explorer/tree/main).
