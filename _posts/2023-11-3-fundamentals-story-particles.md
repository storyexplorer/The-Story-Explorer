The Problem: How do you know what to write?

I first read about them in Pullman's *Daemon Voices* [[^daemon]]. Check out the essays "The Writing of Stories" and "Poco a Poco".

Image schemas are the fundamental building blocks of human experience. Lakoff and Johnson describe in *Meatphors We Live By* [[^MWLB]] how image schemas correspond to the "natural" kinds of experiences that result from human nature: our physical bodies and internal experience, our interactions with our physcial environment, and our interactions with other people within our culture and others. These story particles are what language and metaphor -- and thus stories -- are made of. 

For example, Pullman wrote that the armature (main theme) of *His Dark Materials* is, "if we want the wisdom that comes with experience, we have to leave the innocence behind" [[^daemon]] (pg 43). Leaving something behind fits the image schema of *separation*.
