*What is a story?* Well, what do you think? Don’t just tell yourself you know what a story is. Before moving on, try to come up with your own definition and write it down. 

Really, write it down.

Ok, let’s get started. When I first sat down to write this, I had a curious realization, perhaps one similar to what you just experienced: I thought I knew what a story was, but I could not come up with a good definition of what a story is. I couldn’t figure out a clear definition that informs the experience of a story and the craft of creating one. I simply just couldn’t do it. 

And it’s ok if you couldn’t either. As human beings, we are surrounded by stories like a fish is by water. Stories are hard to define because they are so natural to us. Mark Turner’s research even points to the idea that parable (the mental projection of story onto ourselves and/or other things) is the foundation of the human mind and likely was the origin of language itself [[^Turner]]. 

Nonetheless, not having a simple answer felt like a huge hole in my knowledge of storytelling. Naturally, I thought this would be a great place to start The Story Explorer. It’s a good question to explore, whether you’ve never written a story before or have years of experience. And I think it’s the most fundamental question we can ask. 

Thankfully there are more experienced storytellers/teachers than myself out there. Upon further research, I ended up finding that Brian McDonald -- one of my favorite masters of storytelling and a great teacher -- is co-host, along with Jesse Bryan, of a podcast called You Are a Storyteller [[^YAAS]]. In two different episodes McDonald gave an incredibly insightful answer to our exact question [[^YAAS-1]], [[^YAAS-2]]. 

The rest of this post will sum up what I learned from McDonald. Towards the end, I also include an observation about the importance of metaphor in all this.

But why have a definition of story? 
Two main reasons:
To bring clarity and focus to storytelling. If you don’t know what something is, how do you know what to do to accomplish that thing? How do you know what you’re creating is a story?  We all want to write good stories [[^note-2]]! A definition can help us with the craft and enhance creativity.
To provide a common ground on which communication can happen successfully. If we all understand what a story is then we can discuss our work and goals clearly. This is especially important for teamwork (and writing blog posts about stories, storytelling, and the stories we live by). 

What about other definitions? Why just McDonald’s?
Other definitions I found fell short because they did one or more of the following:
Were vague or peculiarly specific (e.g. used ambiguous terms like “change”, or only included specific forms of communication)
Used synonyms for story in the definition (e.g. “narrative”)
Used elements of a story that only partially describe what a story is (e.g. “plot”)
Used metaphors to describe a story instead of providing a definition (e.g. “a story is a walk through a field of flowers” or something like that. I love a good metaphor, just not out of context in a definition.)
Included words like “entertainment”, “amuse”, etc. , as in something that diverts or . I think we can all agree that a movie like Schindler’s List is a fantastic story, but it’s definitely not “entertaining” or “amusing”.
Did not inform the craft of creating a good or meaningful story

I am going with McDonald’s definition because it didn’t fall on the above list and felt very complete. The first time I heard it, I felt like McDonald just gave words to something I had known all along. And well, that’s exactly what he did. As mentioned above, story (parable) is likely the origin of language itself, so we can look at how we talk to understand stories. When we carefully observe the way people tell stories in conversation, “in the wild” as McDonald suggests, we can experience for ourselves exactly what his definition says.

What is a story?
“A story is the telling or retelling of a sequence of events leading to a conclusion.”
Brian McDonald

Simple and elegant. Let’s break it down: 
“a telling or retelling”: Stories can be told and retold, and I believe it’s safe to say that McDonald implies telling through any communicative medium or form (visual, written, auditory, spoken, etc.).
“a sequence of events”: Stories contain multiple events or “happenings”, whether implied or described.
“leading to a conclusion”: McDonald qualified that he doesn’t mean stories have an end, but that stories have a point. This is where it gets interesting. It’s this last part that separates all the other definitions I came across from McDonald’s.

Let’s go through a quick example of what a story “in the wild” might look like, and this will help explain what McDonald means by a story “leading to a conclusion”.

Proposal, Argument, Conclusion
When we tell a story in conversation, there’s always a point that the story leads to. McDonald highlights Alfred Hitchcock’s observation [[^note-4]] that all stories can be boiled into the following: 

Proposal, Argument, Conclusion.

It may not seem like it, but this explains everything essential about storytelling. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s the E = Mc^2 of storytelling, as McDonald says. Here’s why. When we tell a story in conversation, we usually start with the point, present our case or argument, and a natural conclusion from what we presented. This isn’t something being imposed on language, it’s an observation we can make from the way we tell stories naturally in conversation. Once McDonald pointed this out, I started hearing it everywhere. But in case you want to just keep reading, here’s an example:

“””
I had the craziest dream last night. 
Me and you were in a huge kitchen with all these ovens and counters and cabinets, and everything was made entirely out of gingerbread and candy. There were other people there too, and we were all trying to bake pies. 
The others were breaking off big pieces of gingerbread and candy for their pies. But a very friendly tiger that spoke French walked up to us and recommended we bake a pie with a small piece of candy, carrots, and the very essence of space-time. So the tiger showed us how to measure out and prepare all the ingredients. Then we baked our pie.
When all the pies were done, we tried the others’ first. They weren’t all that good. Way too sweet. And as we tasted each pie, each person complemented our pie then just faded away. Suddenly we -- me, you, and the tiger -- were at home with our pie. We all sat down in the kitchen, had a slice, and the tiger said, “magnifique!” It was the best pie we ever tasted.
When I woke up, I couldn’t believe it. I guess the simple stuff was the secret.
“””

Proposal: “I had the craziest dream last night.”
Argument: “We were in a kitchen…pie we ever tasted.” (the crazy events of the dream)
Conclusion: “When I woke up, I couldn’t believe it. I guess the simple stuff was the secret.”

And here’s a fun experiment: Try taking out any one or two elements of proposal, argument, or conclusion. When I do this, I see that the story suddenly loses context, becomes confusing, or feels unfinished. We lose the essence of McDonald’s definition -- that the story leads to a point “I had a crazy dream”. 

We all naturally talk and tell stories, and it is in this sense that we are all storytellers. We can all create a story if we want. All we have to do is listen carefully. What’s most important to take from this is that when we sit down to write a story, it shouldn’t be any different than how we tell them:

A story is the telling or retelling of a sequence of events leading to a conclusion. A story has a natural structure that comes from language: proposal, argument, conclusion.

But there’s more to what McDonald meant by conclusion or point.

What’s the Point?
McDonald suggests we look at why we tell stories from an evolutionary perspective to understand the question. This was a lightbulb moment for me: Every single human culture we know of told or tells stories, and the only reason why this could be is to pass on survival information. 

By survival information, McDonald means that we tell stories to pass along essential information that helps us survive and live better lives [[^note-5]]. Survival information can be physical, emotional, spiritual, social, cultural, etc. The point of a story is the survival information, and that’s what makes it meaningful. This doesn’t mean that the story has to be life or death survival, but can be about anything as long as it demonstrates some sort of survival information. 

McDonald is not alone in this observation. Armature, thematics…. LeFauve too…

Example thematics from popular movies and books

What’s the Point Made Of?
One observation I’ve had is that the point, thematic, or armature is always some sort of metaphor or can be turned into a metaphor. This tells us that we can apply the emotional thematic by demonstrating the metaphor in the story.

Let’s go back to the Wizard of Oz because that’s a much better story than the one I wrote above. 

Let’s look at an example that could come from conversation so that we can see everything in action.


Conclusion
Here’s our final definition with some additions:
A story is …

This really helps guide us on the purpose of storytelling. It brings clarity and focus to the task of the storyteller and gives insight on why great storytellers are able to consistently craft great stories, even if they are not necessarily aware of all these things. We can even see how basic story structure emerges from the way we talk: Proposal, Argument, Conclusion. It’s not about just entertaining people or just creating a mood. It’s about the communication of survival information, to help others and demonstrate meaningful experiences. Storytellers have a huge responsibility in this respect. 

So if we want to create consciously and with intention and take on this responsibility, we better have a deeper look into the metaphors our point is made of. Of course stories can still be fun. Learning all this, at least for me, fills me with awe. Something I really enjoy doing has a great purpose and function to myself and others. Trust me, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s ideas on metaphor are going to blow your mind away, metaphor very much intended. See you next post.

[^note-1]: Note: It turns out I really did come across two definitions, one from Steering the Craft by Le Guin and one from Pixar’s Story in a Box, but neither stuck with me. Upon revisiting, both definitions felt vague to me. 

[^note-2]: Note: By “good” I mean in the way we linguistically describe how a “good” story feels. A “good” story is one that feels “meaningful”, “moving”, “clear”, “emotional”, “resonant”, etc. These are the stories that were crafted to ensure a complete, embodied communication, and many are considered classics. Also, there are storytellers out there who are able to do this with consistency, so they must be doing something right. More on this in upcoming posts.

[^note-3]: Note: For those who know a bit of structure, this is why you need an Act 1 in your story. Otherwise there is no context and it’s just random events strung together. Please don’t confuse the audience.

[^note-4]: Note: I couldn’t find the original source where Hitchcock said this, but I trust McDonald and that Hitchcock came up with something this brilliant. 

[^note-5]: Note: What about stories told to deceive us? Yes it happens, and it’s not always cool when it does. It’s really up to the one who receives the story to parse it and evaluate their experiences with the one who told it. This really gets into some rabbit hole caveats involving moral philosophy and the philosophy of human nature. I’ve got more of a Lockean view of human nature, so there’s my disclaimer. If you made it this far in this bloated footnote, wow, you must be interested in philosophy. You should definitely read The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins to see some views of human nature demonstrated with brilliant clarity. Even if you’re not interested in philosophy and you’re still reading this, Collins is a master storyteller and you should check it out.
