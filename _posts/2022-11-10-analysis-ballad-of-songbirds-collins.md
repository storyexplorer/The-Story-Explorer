## Overview
- A Masterwork in Philosophical Stakes
- What are philosophical stakes? Why are they important? * Key is that they embed a story with a layer of meaning that stems from how we live, our moral values, our ideas and outlook on the human condtion. This is that extra layer that -- as far as I am aware -- stems from Michael Arndt[LINK to his stakes video essay...].
- Some background on Collins (first eddition of Ballad has that interview), Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau
- Overall structured as a tragedy

## How does this work?
- Conceptual system and metaphors are rooted in the philosophical ideas --> they all get embedded in character action, settings, events...
- Act 1
- Act 2
- Act 3
